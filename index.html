            About
        </h2>
            <p>I am a seasoned professional in the technology and digital space, boasting an expansive career across CMS, digital media, programming, and digital design. I proudly served CBC & Radio-Canada for over 14 years, where I honed my skills in various digital and IT roles. During my years at CBC & Radio-Canada, I also actively participated in content production, audio, video, and column writing. Currently, I am employed at the English Montreal School Board (EMSB) as a CMS Specialist.
            </p>
            <p>Before relocating to Canada, I contributed to the field of online education as a researcher and professional journal editor at the TV&Radio University of China, the Chinese counterpart to TELUQ.
            </p>
            <p>My enthusiasm for AI research keeps me abreast of the latest advancements in technology and the internet. My unique professional journey spanning China and Canada has equipped me with the ability to work across industries and languagesâ€”be it Chinese, French, or English. Guided by a commitment to lifelong learning and problem-solving, I have consistently demonstrated resilience and adaptability throughout my career.</p>
